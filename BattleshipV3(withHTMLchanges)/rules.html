<p>Battleship is a 2-player strategy, memory, and guessing game. The game can be played against a computer or against another player.</p>
<p>Each player has a playing grid and 5 ships to position. Players take turns guessing where the other has positioned his/her ships, "firing" at the ships. The first player to sink the opponent's entire fleet is the winner!</p>
