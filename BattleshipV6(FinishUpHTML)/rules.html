            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <h3>Sink your opponent's fleet of five ships before he sinks yours.</h3>
            <h2>Prepare for Battle!</h2>
            <h3>Players will place five of their ships on their grid
            </br> either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.</h3>
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <h3>Decide who will go first. Then alternate turns,
            </br> shooting at a coordinate on the opponent's grid.
            </br> Once a shot is fired, a coordinate without a ship is
            </br> a miss, while a coordinate with a ship is a hit.</h3>
            <h2>It's a Hit!</h2>
            <h3>Once a ship is hit, it will be marked on
            </br> your map as a hit marker and the player
            </br> will be allowed to shoot a second time.</h3>
            <h2>It's a Miss!</h2>
            <h3>Once a ship is missed, it will be marked
            </br> on your map a missed marker and
            </br> the your opponent will go next.</h3>
            <h2>Sinking a Ship</h2>
            <h3>Once a ship has been hit on all of its markers,
            </br> it will be announced that a ship has sunk.</h3>
            <h2>Winning The Game</h2>
            <h3>To win the game, one player needs to sink
            </br> their opponent's fleet of five ships
          </br> before all of their ships sink.</h3>
